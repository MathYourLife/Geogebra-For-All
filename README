Geogebra-For-All
================

Samples used in math classes for the Geogebra software (http://geogebra.org/)

Files provided here are mostly ones that I created 
while teaching 6-12 mathematics.  Most often used to
demonstrate some principle without needing a lot of
hand motions and multiple graphs drawn on the white board.
